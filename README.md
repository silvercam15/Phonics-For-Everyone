# Phonics-For-Everyone

This chrome extension serves as an accessibility tool for learning to read or for people who have trouble seeing or pronouncing words. The main purpose of the extension is to allow the user to learn though content most relevant for them instead of having a set of predetermined readings from which to choose from. The extension is available to use from any webpage with text and provides both the pronounciation as well as the syllable count and separation.
